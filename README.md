# Prodigy_Task_4
This is my 4th task of my Prodigy Infotech internship, I analyzed and visualized sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion on specific topics or brands. The project involved data collection, sentiment analysis using NLP techniques, and creating visualizations to reveal insights into public attitudes and trends.
